Project 1C README

I worked by myself for this project. I completed all required pages, which can be accessed through the sidebar. The search page is accessed through the sidebar and returns the correct output of the search: a table of matching actors with links to the actor page and another table with matching movies with links to their movie pages. The actor browse page uses a select input box to get the actor name and then returns actor information and a table with links to the movies and roles he has been in. The browse movie page is similar and returns the movie information, a table of all the actors and links to their pages, then the average score, all user comments, and an add comment link. This links to the add movie review page. There are four input pages: moviedirector relation, movieactor relation, add new movie, and add new actor or director. The add new actor or director also allows you to indicate that the person is both an actor and director so that the person will have the same unique id in both tables.
