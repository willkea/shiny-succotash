Project 1C README

I worked by myself for this project. I completed all required pages, which can
be accessed through the sidebar. The search page is accessed through the sidebar
and returns the correct output of the search: a table of matching actors with
links to the actor page and another table with matching movies with links to
their movie pages. The actor browse page uses a select input box to get the
actor name and then returns actor information and a table with links to the
movies and roles he has been in. The browse movie page is similar and returns
the movie information, a table of all the actors and links to their pages, then
the average score, all user comments, and an add comment link. This links to the
add movie review page. There are four input pages: moviedirector relation, movie
actor relation, add new movie, and add new actor or director. The add new actor
or director also allows you to indicate that the person is both an actor and
director so that the person will have the same unique id in both tables. I used
a bootstrap template to make the website look nicer and added a background image
to the homepage.
